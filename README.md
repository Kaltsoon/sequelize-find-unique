Finder for retrieving a single Sequelize model entry by a unique column or a unique combination of multiple columns. Queries that occur in the same tick and have the same `where`, `attributes`, and `include` parameters are automatically batched using a [dataloader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader) and will result in a single database query. This is very useful, especially on a GraphQL server to avoid the [N+1 Problem](https://shopify.engineering/solving-the-n-1-problem-for-graphql-through-batching).

This library is heavily inspired by [Prisma's](https://www.prisma.io/) `findUnique` method.

## Install

With npm:

```bash
npm install sequelize-find-unique
```

With Yarn:

```bash
yarn add sequelize-find-unique
```

## How to use?

A `findUnique` function can be built for a specific Sequelize model by using the `makeFindUnique` function:

```js
const { Sequelize, DataTypes } = require('sequelize');
const { makeFindUnique } = require('sequelize-find-unique');

const sequelize = new Sequelize('sqlite::memory:');

const User = sequelize.define('user', {
  id: { type: DataTypes.INTEGER, primaryKey: true, autoIncrement: true },
  username: { type: DataTypes.TEXT, unique: true },
});

const findUniqueUser = makeFindUnique(User);

// ...

// These queries have the same columns in the where parameter, so they are batched. Just one database query is executed
const users = await Promise.all([
  findUniqueUser({
    where: {
      username: 'john',
    },
  }),
  findUniqueUser({
    where: {
      username: 'mary',
    },
  }),
]);
```

The two `findUniqueUser` queries in the example are batched and only one database query is executed.

### Using as model's static method

The `findUnique` (or name of your choice) static method can be defined for a model in the following way:

```js
User.findUnique = makeFindUnique(User);

// ...

const user = await User.findUnique({
  where: {
    username: 'kalle',
  },
});
```

### Associations

Queries with the same `include` parameter are batched:

```js
// These queries have the same include parameter, so they are batched. Just one database query is executed
const users = await Promise.all([
  User.findUnique({
    where: {
      username: 'john',
    },
    include: { model: Comment },
  }),
  User.findUnique({
    where: {
      username: 'mary',
    },
    include: { model: Comment },
  }),
]);
```

### Composite unique columns

Composite unique columns work just like a single unique column:

```js
// These queries have the same columns in the where parameter, so they are batched. Just one database query is executed
const persons = await Promise.all([
  Person.findUnique({
    where: {
      firstName: 'Kalle',
      lastName: 'Ilves',
    },
  }),
  Person.findUnique({
    where: {
      firstName: 'John',
      lastName: 'Doe',
    },
  }),
]);
```

## TypeScript

The library is written in TypeScript, so types are on the house!

If you are using a static method like in the previous examples, just declare the method on your model class:

```ts
import { makeFindUnique } from 'sequelize-find-unique';

export class User extends Model<
  InferAttributes<User>,
  InferCreationAttributes<User>
> {
  declare id: CreationOptional<number>;
  declare username: string;

  declare static findUnique: (
    options: FindOptions<Attributes<User>>,
  ) => Promise<User | null>;
}

// ...

User.findUnique = makeFindUnique(User);
```
